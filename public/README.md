# Public Directory

This directory is empty for a reason: [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) needs it, else it fails to compile. This is where the result, the output, the plugin, will be.

## Compile commands

- To build the project once: `yarn run build`
- To build the release version (minified): `yarn run release`
- To re-build the project every time there is a change: `yarn run watch`
